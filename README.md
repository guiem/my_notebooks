# My Notebooks

As simple as that. A set of my own notebooks, sometimes simply serving the purpose of following some tutorial (or as a place to take notes) and at other times digging a bit deeper:

* [__Anniversary__](https://github.com/guiem/my_notebooks/blob/master/anniversary/anniversary.ipynb): analysis of ~75K text phone messages exchanged with my partner. [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/7v4r0l/i_analyzed_75k_text_phone_messages_exchanged_with/) for more ideas =)   

* [__MNIST__](https://github.com/guiem/my_notebooks/blob/master/tensorflow_and_deeplearning/mnist.ipynb): yet another MNIST tutorial. You won't find anything new here, I was just getting familiar with Tensorflow. However, what I don't usually find in other tutorials are practical ways to save / restore models or even to feed an individual photo and predict its class. So I made sure that I was trying all this stuff, plus a naive reflection in the end on how deep learning works 🤖 versus how we humans 👴 learn/model_knowledge.

* [__Automata__](automata): exploring Automata (and Turing Machines) theory through a series of examples and exercices.

* [__Python Unicode, how to avoid UnicodeEncodeError?__](https://github.com/guiem/my_notebooks/blob/master/python_unicode.ipynb): Tired of the freaking “*UnicodeEncodeError: ‘ascii’ codec can’t encode character u’\motherf++++++’ in position 69: ordinal not in range(128)*“ error message?

* [__Interesting concepts__](https://github.com/guiem/my_notebooks/blob/master/concepts.ipynb): a simple list of (useful?) concepts I don't want to forget. 

* [__Euler's number__](https://github.com/guiem/my_notebooks/blob/master/eulers_number.ipynb): I just like Euler's number... wanna add cool facts about _e_? Fork it and share!

And remember, if you don't like Jupyter notebooks you can always export them as Python scripts:

```
jupyter nbconvert --to script <name of the notebook>
```
