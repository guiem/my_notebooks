# My Notebooks

As simple as that. A set of my own notebooks, sometimes simply serving the purpose of following some tutorial (or as a place to take notes) and at other times digging a bit deeper:

* [__Anniversary__](anniversary/anniversary.ipynb): analysis of ~75K text phone messages exchanged with my partner. [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/7v4r0l/i_analyzed_75k_text_phone_messages_exchanged_with/) for more ideas =)   

* [__Pandas vs. Numpy (matrix dot product) & Word Embeddings__](pandas_vs_numpy/pandas_vs_numpy.ipynb): performance comparative between Pandas and Numpy on a very specific operation - `dot` product - (to compute similarity between word embeddings). [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/85okdr/pandas_vs_numpy_my_personal_quest_with_graphs_and/) and [Medium](https://medium.com/@guiem/pandas-vs-numpy-test-it-yourself-10ac834e4d1e) posts.

* [__MNIST__](tensorflow_and_deeplearning/mnist.ipynb): yet another MNIST tutorial. You won't find anything new here, I was just getting familiar with Tensorflow. However, what I don't usually find in other tutorials are practical ways to save / restore models or even to feed an individual photo and predict its class. So I made sure that I was trying all this stuff, plus a naive reflection in the end on how deep learning works ðŸ¤– versus how we humans ðŸ‘´ learn/model_knowledge.

* [__Automata__](automata): exploring Automata (and Turing Machines) theory through a series of examples and exercices.

* [__Python Unicode, how to avoid UnicodeEncodeError?__](python_unicode.ipynb): Tired of the freaking â€œ*UnicodeEncodeError: â€˜asciiâ€™ codec canâ€™t encode character uâ€™\motherf++++++â€™ in position 69: ordinal not in range(128)*â€œ error message?

* [__Interesting concepts__](concepts.ipynb): a simple list of (useful?) concepts I don't want to forget. 

* [__Euler's number__](eulers_number.ipynb): I just like Euler's number... wanna add cool facts about _e_? Fork it and share!

And remember, if you don't like Jupyter notebooks you can always export them as Python scripts:

```
jupyter nbconvert --to script <name of the notebook>
```
