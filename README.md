# My Notebooks

As simple as that. A set of my own notebooks, sometimes simply serving the purpose of following some tutorial (or as a place to take notes) and at other times digging a bit deeper:

* [__Python Unicode, how to avoid UnicodeEncodeError?__](https://github.com/guiem/my_notebooks/blob/master/python_unicode.ipynb): Tired of the freaking “*UnicodeEncodeError: ‘ascii’ codec can’t encode character u’\motherf++++++’ in position 69: ordinal not in range(128)*“ error message?

* [__Interesting concepts__](https://github.com/guiem/my_notebooks/blob/master/concepts.ipynb): a simple list of (useful?) concepts I don't want to forget.
