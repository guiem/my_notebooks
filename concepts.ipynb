    "\n",
    "Normalization (shifting inputs to zero-mean and unit variance) is often used as a pre-processing step to make the data comparable across features. As the data flows through a deep network, the weights and parameters adjust those values, sometimes making the data too big or too small again - a problem the authors refer to as \"internal covariate shift\". By normalizing the data in each mini-batch, this problem is largely avoided."
